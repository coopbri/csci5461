# CSCI5461 Final Project
## Quantum Support Vector Machine (Qiskit)
<br>

This is my final project for CSCI 5461 (Functional Genomics, Systems Biology, and Bioinformatics) at University of Minnesota. I implemented and tested a quantum support vector machine algorithm using Qiskit (with a classical radial-basis function kernel SVM for experimental reference).

The Jupyter notebook describing the entire project can be seen [here](5461Project.ipynb).
